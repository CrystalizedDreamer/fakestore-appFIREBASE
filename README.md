# FakeStoreApp
I was finally able to figure out how to commit to github directly from my laptop. REJOICE

Alright, enough of that.

This project was assigned by my friends and mentors at Coding temple
This represents my work bringing together REACT Bootstrap, and API integrations. 

I have only a few thoughts: I do not care much for Bootstrap (for aesthetic reasons, not for functionality reasons
I lovvveee React, it is so much faster and more flexible than my time making static websites

I decided to practice separating out my components into different modules in order to promote better readability

************************************************************

1.33 update

Refactored the Codebase in order to comply with using Redux and React Query as expected in the project guidelines utilizing my old fakestore app as a jumping off point. (why rebuild an entire project from scratch, I meannnn.)

The app functionally works the same as before. 
The HOME page is not actually a home page

The products page has been retrofitted with a functioning cart and checkout feature, as well as a dynamic filter utilizing React Query in order to filter products out by category

I ran into more than a few troubles on my own of a few redundancies (such as two nearly identical modals for the cart) or removing context api in order to make use of REDUX instead (or the fact that I make syntax errors at a rate that suggest I can't handle simple english occasionally) but we in fact made it

For the sake of proper team work I must remember to comment my code more often and sync changes more incrementally. I tend to work and commit in such large blocks at once that i once took  me about an hour to figure out where in my code I broke the app. Eventually I turned to copilot for efficiency in illucidating my fun little screw ups

The Cart does in fact persist via session memory

I went step by step through the rubric to make sure I hit every checkbox. 
In the future though it may be more beneficial to read the entire thing first, As I originally proceeded entirely with contextAPI until realizing REDUX was a requirement.
